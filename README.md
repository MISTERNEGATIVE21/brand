# Official dahliaOS brand assets

The **dahliaOS** brand is unique and it belongs to the dahliaOS organization

## Logotype and logomark

dahliaOS claims two marks: the “dahliaOS” logotype and the “dahliaOS” logomark

Both should be used with the following in mind:

- Do not stretch, skew, rotate, flip, or otherwise alter the mark

- Do not attempt to recreate the logotype or logomark

The logotype/logomark should always be as they are unless they are: 

- on a white background, then use the version of the logotype/logomark with the drop shadow

</p>

The logotype is to be used when space allows to refer to dahliaOS, or it can be used before a product name to refer to a specific app/service of dahliaOS

</p>

The “dahliaOS” logomark is to be used to refer to dahliaOS when there is not enough space for the full logotype or a square ratio is required

## Project and product names

dahliaOS is always lower-case, even when beginning sentences

It can also be used along with product names (for example, “dahliaOS App Store”) to refer to a specific application/service

For clarity, dahliaOS should never be shortened to any abbreviation

## Font

We use Sulphur Point for headings, for smaller headings and body text we use Roboto

## Third Parties & Community

We kindly ask third-party developers creating apps/designs for dahliaOS to adopt certain elements of the dahliaOS brand for consistency:

- Color

- Fonts

However, we restrict the usage of the dahliaOS name and marks:

- You are encouraged to say that your app or service is “designed for dahliaOS,” but do not use the dahliaOS name or marks as part of the name of your company, application, product, or service—or in any logo you create

- Only use the dahliaOS name or marks to refer to dahliaOS or its products
